    - Pink ghost “Pinky” will try to get 4 tiles in front of Pac-Man.
    - Blue ghost “Inky” will target a special position.
        - Draw a line from Blinky’s position to the cell two tiles in front of Pac-Man, then double the length of the line.
        - That is Inky’s target position.
    - Orange ghost “Clyde” will target Pac-Man directly, but will scatter whenever he gets within an 8 tile radius of Pac-Man.

- Fruit appears after enough dots are eaten.
- The fruit appears twice per level, generally near the maze center.
- If you don’t eat the fruit quickly, it will disappear after a few seconds.
- From Level 13 onward, the fruit remains a Key, awarding the maximum 5,000 points per appearance.

- White gates should not be accessible by pacman (= pacman cannot enter prison but ghosts can, e.g. when they die)
